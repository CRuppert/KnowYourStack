While `condense` will result in smaller code size, it also breaks a common way to structure HTML as it removes all whitespace between elements *if it contains new lines*.\r\n\r\nPlease add an option that condenses all whitespace between elements into a single space *regardless of whether it contains new lines*. Such an option might also be the better default than `condense` as it is closer to what you would expect from your HTML.\r\n\r\nExample using Vue CLI with the default `condense` option:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<p>\r\n  <span>1</span> <span>a</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <span>2</span>\r\n  <span>b</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <span>3</span>\r\n  <span>\r\n    c\r\n  </span>\r\n</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in the following output in the browser:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 a\r\n2b\r\n3 c \r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is no whitespace between `2b`. While this behaviour is properly documented in the vue-template-compiler docs, it is not intuitive. Structuring HTML like in `2` is very common and it should not be necessary to restructure it like `3`. In addition to being unintuitive, it is currently very hard to find out which package with which configuration and which default options is actually responsible for that behaviour. It is thus super hard to reconfigure your setup according to your needs. And even if you manage to do that, you must decide between no minification with `preserve` and minification that might break your HTML with `condense`. I think there should be a middle ground.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nIntroduce an option `condense-keep` or similar. Using that instead of `condense` will always keep one whitespace between elements regardless of any new lines.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

This makes it impossible for users to define the structure of their own metadata. As an example, I wish to use the \"meta\" property for middleware. I've created a Middleware type and would like an interface like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeclare module \"vue-router\" {\r\n    interface Route {\r\n        meta: {\r\n            middleware?: Middleware[]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I try to define it this way, I get an error saying that all declarations of \"meta\" must have identical modifiers, and that \"meta\" was already defined in router.d.ts... However if I DON'T define it this way then I lose the ability to statically type check this property and catch developers who accidentally pass an incorrect type (e.g. passing a string containing the middleware's name, instead of the middleware object itself)\r\n\r\nNow there's admittedly a limitation of this. Currently, it's possible to pass a non-object for the meta of a route. If you want to stick just a number or a string in there, it's completely valid. Making this a user-extensible interface would eliminate that use case (and therefore be a breaking API change) -- but I find it highly suspect that anyone is using the meta field in that way in a production app of any meaningful size. Without key-value pairs, storing only a single string into the \"meta\" field doesn't feel very useful.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\n```\r\nexport interface Route {\r\n  path: string\r\n  name?: string | null\r\n  hash: string\r\n  query: Dictionary<string | (string | null)[]>\r\n  params: Dictionary<string>\r\n  fullPath: string\r\n  matched: RouteRecord[]\r\n  redirectedFrom?: string\r\n  meta?: {} // <-- replaced \"any\" with \"{}\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

While `beforeRouteUpdate` and `beforeRouteLeave` could get such access through `this.$router` and `this.$options`, it seems not way to achieve it in `beforeRouteEnter`. Importing router instance (similar to store import suggestion [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/2118#issuecomment-484037415)) is not an option for us because we have shared set of router components, which are re-used in different vue applications, so there is no single place to import it from.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create generic plugin for our applications which will define hook to pre-load data. In some component data pre-load will happen via vuex store, so it should be accessible in this hook.\r\n\r\nHere is simplified code for the plugin:\r\n```js\r\nexport default function install(Vue) {\r\n  Vue.mixin({\r\n    async beforeRouterEnter(to, from, next) {\r\n      if (componentOptions.preloadData) {\r\n        try {\r\n          const nextCallback = componentOptions.preloadData.call(null, router.app.$store);\r\n          next(nextCallback);\r\n        } catch (error) {\r\n          // Custom error for a generic error handler\r\n          next(new DataPreloadError(error));\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        next();\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis plugin will make it possible to define custom `preloadData() { ... }` component option for a generic data pre-load as part of routing process. The only missing  references to make it work are `componentOptions` and `router`.\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible to provide `router` access in this particular example by passing it as plugin argument – `export default function install(Vue, router) { ... }`. However, it might be still beneficial to have access to router in the `beforeRouteEnter` guard, as it will be a solution for #3157.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nProposal is to add additional `guardContext` argument to the guard function:\r\n```js\r\nbeforeRouteEnter(to, from, next, context) {\r\n // where context is { router: ..., componentOptions: ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever if it should be implemented in different way – would be great to hear it.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

However, someone suggests that it's okay to use commit directly in components when it is so obvious.\r\n\r\nIn order to take the benefits of both approach, I suggests a simple mutateAction, which can mutate state directly like mutations and called by components in a same way as normal actions.

The component only references `state.rootObject.prop1` via a getter and a mutation to increment it. This can be seen when clicking the 'Inc Prop1' button.\r\n\r\nWhen another property is added to the `rootObject` (via the 'Add Prop2' button), the component is updated with no change to the underlying data (`rootObject.prop1`) as can be seen in the console. Calls to `incProp2` can be seen to change this new property value, but no component update is triggered (as expected). Finally, deleting `rootObject.prop2` also triggers a component update, despite `rootObject.prop1` not changing.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNone of the mutations associated with `prop2` would trigger the component bound to `prop1` to update.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nCreation and deletion of 'peer' properties of `prop1` are triggering component updates. Mutation of 'peer' properties are (correctly) _not_ triggering updates.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis could be my misunderstanding of how Vuex actually works (in version 3), but it is causing my app performance issues when unrelated changes in state are triggering many hundreds / thousands of component updates (with no visible data changing). If there is any way to configure or use Vuex, allowing properties to be added / removed _without_ causing updates of existing properties, I couldn't find it in the documentation.\r\n\r\nNote this example could easily be solved by having 2 separate state properties. But this is an example of deeply nested real-world data backed by firestore, so separating all the properties out isn't a workable solution there.\r\n\r\nI was also curious to see if Vuex 4 changed this behaviour in any way, but I couldn't find or figure out a codepen setup for Vuex 4 yet—happy to experiment if there is one.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
